# Lab_3_Practice

I am writing this as preparation for the Laboratory 3 from Advanced Programming CIIC4010.

Now, I am writing this from the VSCode App! I will need to use the "push" command to see the changes on GitHub.

Successfully "pushed" the changes to GitHub! To end this practice, I will now "pull" this addition to VSCode. 

All Done!
